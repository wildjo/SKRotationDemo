# SpriteKit Rotation Demo

## Why is this here?

Writing my first SpriteKit iOS app, I wanted the app to be able to handle different device orientations. iOS has built-in rotation animations and I wanted to replace them with an animation of my own. I spent several weeks trying to find a way to replace the built-in rotations, but only found ways to supplement the built-in rotation animations, and no way to replace them.

So, I set about learning how to build my own. This is the result of that. It may not be the correct way. There may be a better way, but I couldn't find it. If you have a better way, please feel free to leave a note here.'

## What does it do?

Rotates a sprite in response to changes in device orientation.

## How is it done?

This sample code is based off of a new Xcode project.
